## 1. [Ready Player 50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/ready/)

The CS50 Duck has a secret. Can you convince it to reveal its secret? Join CS50 and [Lakera.ai](https://lakera.ai) for a challenge in which you’ll face none other than CS50’s duck debugger, aka **ddb**, an experimental AI for [rubberducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). But be warned: each time you crack the code, the CS50 Duck will “level up” and become more protective.
